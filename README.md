# Image_Segmentation_Tensorflow
Image segmentation using tensorflow. 
Used 2-D convolutional layers to reduce the spatial dimension of an image and then recontruct the spatial dimensions by reducing the depth features.

TODO: Try to upsample using "de-convolutional" layers, http://warmspringwinds.github.io/tensorflow/tf-slim/2016/11/22/upsampling-and-image-segmentation-with-tensorflow-and-tf-slim/
